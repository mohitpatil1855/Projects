This project is a simple Client–Server Chat Application implemented in Java using TCP sockets.
The server listens on port 5100, accepts a client connection, and both sides communicate using continuous input/output streams. Messages are exchanged in a loop until the client types "end".

It demonstrates core networking concepts such as:

--Creating sockets (Socket, ServerSocket)
--Stream-based communication (BufferedReader, PrintStream)
--Full-duplex message exchange
--Basic blocking I/O mechanisms in Java
--This project is ideal for beginners learning Java networking and understanding how TCP communication work
